<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a college student, passionate about exploring the world of technology and coding. With a strong foundation in programming languages like C, C++, Python, and some experience in HTML, I enjoy building practical solutions that solve real-world problems. Currently, I am diving deeper into web development with Flask and working on a website focused on foods and beverages, blending my love for technology with creativity.<br>

Beyond coding, I find joy in pushing boundaries and embracing challenges, which reflects in my admiration for the Yamaha YZF-R1 motorcycleâ€”a symbol of speed, precision, and engineering excellence.

In my free time, I enjoy collaborating on innovative projects, learning new skills, and finding inspiration in everyday moments. My journey is driven by curiosity, continuous improvement, and the desire to make a meaningful impact</p>
